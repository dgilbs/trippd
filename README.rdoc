Trip'd is a travel itinerary planning app.  Users can sign up and create "trips" which they can then add destinations and add activities to. Each destination has activities based on user interests - ie "Shopping", "Restaurants", "Fitness", "Cultural", etc. 

The application uses the Yelp API to populate activites for each destination. It is a rails app with JavaScript/JQuery incorporated.

Built by Mallory Coppenrath, Daniel Gilberg, Joe Lehr, and Greta Moseson.
